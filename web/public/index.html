				Hi, I'm Nico. I work at Twitter where I'm part of the Spaces team. We're working on ways to connect
				people through audio. Audio is inherently slower to consume than text, leading to deeper conversations
				and more empathy. It's a nice change from the rapid-fire hot takes that short, text-based Tweets
				encourage. If you get a chance, check out the Space tab in the Twitter app, and let me know if you found
				a conversation you enjoyed or if you have feedback on how to make it better.

				Before I worked on the Spaces team, I was the tech lead for the search infrastructure team at Twitter.
				We ran the massive search engine that drives Twitter search, the home timeline, and a bunch of other
				products at Twitter. It was rare for us to ship features that end users would notice, but our search
				engine was a super power for our customers, the product development teams at Twitter. Check out the <a

					post</a> I co-wrote and <a
					href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2020/09/23/twitter-search-with-nico-tonozzi/">the
					podcast</a>
				I was interviewed in if you're interested in learning more about the problems we got to work on. In the
				past, I worked at Sourcegraph where I built most of the code browsing UI and helped launch code search.

				When I'm not programming, I try to stay active and get outside as much as I can. Lately, I've been
				training for some ski mountaineering and running races. I'm a proud dog dad and live in Golden,
				Colorado.
